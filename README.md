# Sweet and Sowers - Backend
Sweet and Sowers is a San Francisco meal delivery service. They offer weekly meals and farmer's market boxes. This app allows the business owners to upload their weekly offerings via excel and their users to order weekly offerings, adjust portion sizing and see their total price. 

You can find the backend for this project [here](https://github.com/MagdalenaJasmine/sweet_sower_api)

## Motivation
I wanted to create an app that helped the Sweet and Sowers move from doing all of their business over email to something that required less work and tracking on their end.
